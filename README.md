# Original Description below:

This is the official Kaggle page for the DKE/KEN3450 "Data Analysis" competition.
Overview

In this competition, you will work with real data from some "clickbait" articles. We are interested in predicting what drives the popularity and clicking rates of such articles. Data are supposed to be clean (but you know how to guarantee that right?). We will be using features related to the following aspects:

    words: number of words in title, content, word length, etc.
    links: number of links to other articles
    digital media: number of images, videos
    publication time: weekend or not
    keywords: number of keywords, article category, ...
    NLP features: title/text polarity/subjectivity, ...

Our goal is to predict the number of shares of each article.
